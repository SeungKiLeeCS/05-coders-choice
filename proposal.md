## Proposed Project

Our app is a collaborative youtube playlist built using Reactjs, Phoenix, and Electron and we named it Endlist. Endlist seeks to provide a simple and easy way to manage playlists among a large group of people. Generally in a large group setting like party, one person will typically have a machine that controls the music in the room. Endlist allows the user to invite people, join playlists, add songs, and vote on the songs, thereby democratizing the playlist management. Because the application requires streaming videos in sync among a large group of people, minimizing the latency is critical. For this very reason, we've chosen Elixir/Phoenix for our backend. 

## Outline Structure

Endlist will be an umbrella application

> just need to understand the direction you plan to take. Again, three
> or four sentences are probably enough.
